//TODO!
//The coding question was to find a path in maze (two dimensional array with 1 and 0 - where 1 is a wall and 0 allows you to move on)
// Code a function 'solve1', which returns true if there's a path from points 's' (start) to 'e' (end) which passes only through zeros. It should return 'false' if there is no possible path.

// Possible movements: up, right, down, left (no diagonals)

// For example, this maze should return true:


//given array of integers and number find the range of indexes in the array that the average of them form the given number.

//2. Implement set interval and clear timeout without using the original functions.

//Lets say you would want to support a full CRUD system. How would you go around doing that? Elaborate specifically.

//Implement a function that sums up the amount of words that are in the same length and have the same letters.

//Write an algorithm that, given a list of courses and dependencies between them (e.g. given courses x,y,z you have to take course x in order to take courses y and z), outputs all of the possible sequences of course-taking.

//Given an unsorted array with duplicates of letters, the array should be returned without the duplicates without importance to the order, the point of the question was to implement a set

//Q: an array of numbers, find the smallest subset with an avg they gave.
